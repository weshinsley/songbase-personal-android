# Songbase Personal Viewer for Android

This is a simple android version of SBScreen. It runs a private web server on an Android device,
which can receive messages from the Songbase main app, when Songbase is configured to send
messages to the Android's IP address. 

The use I have in mind, is to help those with eyesight challenges to have a way of keeping
up with song lyrics that may be on other big screens, and keep connected with the meetings. I 
hope it does so, and especially welcome feedback from those who find it useful, or indeed
"potentially useful" with further changes.
